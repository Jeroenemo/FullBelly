# Name of Student: Jeroen van Seeters

# Name of Project: Full Belly

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Coming from the food industry, I am acutely aware of the egregious amount of food waste that occurs on a regular basis. This application will allow users to sign in as donors/recipients, and use google maps to post/find a viable meal nearby before it meets the dumpster. This includes misfires at restaurants, baked goods that won’t be able to be sold next day at your local coffee shop, or companies that get their lunches catered that usually have lots and lots of leftovers. The socioeconomic gap in our culture today is immense. I believe by reaching out a helping hand and providing someone with a meal they didn’t have to fish out of the trash can have an immensely positive impact on how we view and treat each other as human beings. This is a really easy way we could help someone less fortunate begin their journey to a happier future. Every positive change begins with a full belly. 

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

backend with C# and MySQL database
front end with react
user can sign in and look for donations, or make/manage donations they made. 


## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

C#
MySQL
React

 
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Handle database payload with GraphQL
Google Maps API to display donations
Build a mobile version with React Native
Get it deployed on AWS 

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

GraphQL
Google API
React Native
AWS >> probably with Docker because C# and AWS don’t play nice.
