## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
<br>
Coming from the food industry, I am acutely aware of the egregious amount of food waste that occurs on a regular basis. This application will allow users to sign in as donors/recipients, and use google maps to post/find a viable meal nearby before it meets the dumpster. This includes misfires at restaurants, baked goods that won‚Äôt be able to be sold next day at your local coffee shop, or companies that get their lunches catered that usually have lots and lots of leftovers. The socioeconomic gap in our culture today is immense. I believe by reaching out a helping hand and providing someone with a meal they didn‚Äôt have to fish out of the trash can have an immensely positive impact on how we view and treat each other as human beings. This is a really easy way we could help someone less fortunate begin their journey to a happier future. Every positive change begins with a full belly.
